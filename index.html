<h2>Final project</h2>
<p>This project utilizes the CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies)</p>
<p>dataset available through <a href="https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels">NCAR Research Applications Laboratory.</a></p>
<p>Precipitation (mm/day) and runoff (mm/day) data for 15 USGS stream gauges were used for the plots.<p/>

<h2>Precipitation Plots</h2> 
<p>Total annual precipitation is summed over the entire 12 month period for any given year.<p/>
<p>Available data for gauge 08050800 begins on October 1, 1985.<p/>

<p>Mean annual precipitation is averaged over the entire 12 month period for any given year.<p/>

<h2>Runoff Efficiency</h2>
<p>Runoff efficiency is runoff/precipitation. Annual means were used.<p/>   
<img src="/Final Project/Annual_Runoff_Coeff.png" width="1000"/>
<br>
<p>Runoff efficiency is based on overall annual means.<p/>
