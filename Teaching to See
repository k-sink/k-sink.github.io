Documentary about Inge Druckrey and her methods of teaching and impressions made upon former students. 
10 points of observation that I made from the film are:
1. Reduce to verbs, actions and gestures
2. Control the whitespace because the negative space is just as important
3. Go beyond what it is and understand what it is doing
4. Really analyze and capture the nuances 
5. Stare at your work, distill it down to its base and intention
6. Pay attention to transitions and the details
7. Positioning and organization can transform an image
8. The eyes should direct the action and the flow should be organic
9. You can communicate the complex rather simply
10. Invoke curiosity and thought and create a lasting impression
