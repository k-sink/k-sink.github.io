This video shows Stephen Malinowski playing the piano while the score and animation simultaneously 
accompany him. The simple rectangular shapes and colors scroll along in a melodious forward progression 
of Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor (Opus 27, No. 2, “Moonlight Sonata”) by Ludwig van Beethoven.

The visualization allows the viewer to connect with the music, understand the variations and nuances. 
The transitions between the purples, greens, blues, oranges, yellows, and reds, breaks down the complex. 
A sonata is decomposed into simple shapes and colors which are then woven back together. The animated 
score brings the music to life in a way that anyone can comprehend and appreciate. The eyes are able 
to process multiple features at once and translate the complex in a way that the ear cannot. Combining
these senses allows the visual to enhance the auditory, amplifying the experience. 

The shapes stair step while the notes climb or descend the lines and spaces on the sheet music. 
The vibrancy of the colors increases when the notes they are linked to are played. Their diminished 
saturation indicates a rest or the individuality of the notes. The punctuation, note duration, timing of 
the notes, the pitch and a change in scale, harmonies between the treble and bass, range and simultaneous 
transitions and intricate chords are highlighted and beautifully represented in simplicity.
